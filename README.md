# Marketplace_Management
 Project on Relational Database and SQL and NoSQL

The Marketplace Management project focuses on designing and implementing a robust relational database management system (RDBMS) to efficiently manage various aspects of a marketplace, including orders, delivery, payments, and user data. This database system is designed to handle a large volume of records, providing seamless data retrieval and manipulation functionalities.

Key Achievements:

- Database Design: Designed Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EER), Unified Modeling Language (UML), Conceptual, and Logical schemas to lay the foundation for the relational marketplace database.
  
- Database Implementation: Developed a relational database system using PostgreSQL, consisting of 10 interconnected tables. This system effectively manages over 30,000 records of orders, delivery, payment, and user information.
  
- Normalization: Executed normalization techniques, including 2nd Normal Form (2NF), 3rd Normal Form (3NF), and 4th Normal Form (4NF), to remove data dependencies and ensure data integrity.
  
- Table Views: Created table views to encapsulate complex SQL queries, providing users with simplified access to data. Utilized tools like Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the outcomes of 15+ SQL queries.

Database Components:

1. Orders Table: Stores information about orders placed by users.
2. Delivery Table: Manages details of order deliveries, including shipment tracking.
3. Payment Table: Tracks payment transactions and methods used by users.
4. Users Table: Stores user profiles and authentication credentials.
5. Products Table: Manages information about products available in the marketplace.
6. Categories Table: Stores product categories for organization and classification.
7. Feedback Table: Records user feedback and reviews for products and services.
8. Inventory Table: Tracks inventory levels and stock availability.
9. Sales Table: Stores data related to sales transactions and revenue.
10. Admins Table: Manages administrative access and privileges within the system.

Data Integrity and Security:

- Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.
- Utilized encryption techniques to secure sensitive user information and payment details.
- Implemented role-based access control to manage user privileges and access levels.

Visualization and Analysis:

- Utilized Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the outcomes of SQL queries, providing insights into database performance and data trends.

Conclusion:

The Marketplace Management Database System serves as a crucial component in streamlining marketplace operations, ensuring efficient management of orders, payments, deliveries, and user interactions. By leveraging normalization techniques, robust database design, and visualization tools, the system facilitates seamless data retrieval, manipulation, and analysis, contributing to the overall success of the marketplace platform.
